# Nuts Pet Food Website

This repository contains the marketing site for Nuts Pet Food. It is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and vanilla JavaScript.

## Quick start

1. Install Node.js 18 or later from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the printed URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser to preview changes in real time.

## Editing the site

If you're comfortable editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly, the key files live in the [`src/`](src) folder:

- [`src/index.html`](src/index.html) – page structure and text.
- [`src/style.css`](src/style.css) – colors, fonts, and layout.
- [`src/main.js`](src/main.js) – light JavaScript that wires the page together.

For a step-by-step walkthrough aimed at new contributors with little to no coding experience, read the [Beginner Editing Guide](docs/beginner-guide.md).

## Deploying

When you're ready to publish, build the site with:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will appear in the `dist/` folder, ready to be uploaded to your hosting provider.
