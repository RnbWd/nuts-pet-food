# Beginner Editing Guide

Welcome! This guide walks through the basics of updating the Nuts Pet Food website even if you have never written code before. Set aside 30â€“45 minutes for your first edit and follow the steps in order.

---

## 1. Set up your tools

1. **Install Node.js**
   - Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/), download the "LTS" installer for your computer, and run it. This installs both Node.js and the `npm` tool we will use.
2. **Install a code editor**
   - Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is free and friendly for beginners.
3. **Download the project files**
   - Ask an existing developer to invite you to the GitHub repository.
   - Click the green **Code** button on GitHub and choose **Download ZIP**.
   - Unzip the folder somewhere easy to find (for example, your Desktop).

> ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Whenever you see text formatted like `this`, it means you should type the command exactly as shown.

---

## 2. Open the project in VS Code

1. Launch **VS Code**.
2. Click **File â†’ Open Folderâ€¦** and choose the folder you unzipped (it should be named `nuts-pet-food`).
3. VS Code will show the project files in the left sidebar. The most important files are inside the `src` folder:
   - `index.html` â€“ controls the words and structure on the page.
   - `style.css` â€“ controls colors, spacing, and fonts.
   - `images/` â€“ stores pictures used on the site.

## 3. Install project dependencies

We only have to do this the first time on a computer.

1. In VS Code choose **Terminal â†’ New Terminal**.
2. A panel will open at the bottom. Make sure it shows the project folder path (ending in `nuts-pet-food`).
3. Run the install command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   - The first run can take a few minutes. Wait until the command finishes and you see a new prompt (usually starting with `>` or the folder name).

## 4. Start the preview server

1. In the same terminal run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. After a few seconds you will see a message with a URL such as `http://localhost:5173/`.
3. Hold **Ctrl (or Cmd) + click** the URL to open it in your browser. This is your live previewâ€”any saved changes will refresh automatically.

> ðŸ›‘ Leave this terminal window running while you edit. If you close it, the preview will stop.

---

## 5. Make a simple change

1. In VS Code click `src/index.html`.
2. Find the text you want to change (for example, the main headline).
3. Edit the text between the tags. For example:
   ```html
   <h1>Healthy, Crunchy Treats for Your Pets</h1>
   ```
4. Press **Ctrl/Cmd + S** to save. Switch back to the browserâ€”your change should appear immediately.

### Changing a picture

1. Copy your new image into the `src/images/` folder.
2. In `index.html`, update the `<img>` tag to point to the new file name:
   ```html
   <img src="./images/new-treats-bag.jpg" alt="Bag of Nuts Pet Food treats" />
   ```
3. Save the file to see the updated picture in the browser.

### Adjusting colors or fonts

1. Open `src/style.css`.
2. Look for the section that matches what you want to change (for example, the header background).
3. Replace the color value with a new one:
   ```css
   .hero {
     background-color: #f3c06b;
   }
   ```
4. Save the file and check the preview.

## 6. Review your work

- Scroll through the preview site to make sure everything looks right.
- Check on a phone or resize the browser window to confirm the layout still works.
- Ask a teammate to review if you are unsure about a change.

---

## 7. Share your changes

Once you are happy with the edits you have two options:

### Option A â€“ Ask a developer to publish

1. Leave the `nuts-pet-food` folder in place with your saved changes.
2. Let the team know which files you updated. They can pull your edits into the official Git repository and deploy them.

### Option B â€“ Learn Git basics (recommended)

1. Ask a teammate to help you set up Git and GitHub Desktop.
2. Commit your changes with a clear message (for example, "Update hero headline and hero image").
3. Open a Pull Request for review.

---

## 8. Stopping the preview

- In the terminal window showing the dev server press **Ctrl + C** to stop it.
- You can restart it any time with `npm run dev`.

---

## Need help?

- Share screenshots or describe what you triedâ€”no question is too small.
- Common fixes:
  - If the terminal says a command is unknown, make sure Node.js is installed and that you reopened VS Code after installing it.
  - If the browser does not refresh, confirm the dev server is still running.

Happy editing! ðŸŽ‰
